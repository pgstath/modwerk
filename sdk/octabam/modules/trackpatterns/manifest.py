"""TRACK PATTERNS -- each track plays its own pattern of the playing bank,
clip style: a change is queued per track and lands at the end of that
track's own loop. Everything else (tempo, the Part's machines, samples and
FX, scenes, MASTER LENGTH, chains) stays stock.

How: where the sequencer hands a track's step to the step handler
(trackpattern.c, adapter.c), the pattern argument is replaced by the
track's own; where the per-track advance compares the track's counter with
its length, the length comes from that pattern. A track with no change set
gets exactly what stock passes.

The gesture: hold [TRACK n], hold [PATTERN], press [TRIG k] queues pattern
k for track n (M1..M8 in MIDI mode); without a TRACK key held, PATTERN +
TRIG is stock's global change, which clears every override.

STATUS (0.1.0-experimental, 22 Oct 2026):
- The engine and glue pass the host tests.
- The sites below were read from the contributor's original 1.40C
  (INVESTIGATION.md section 4), and each is guarded by its stock bytes.
- It ran under the ColdFire emulator, and on one MKII the contributor
  reported these builds of this source as passing (TESTING.md):
  - octabam builds OCTABAM1-3: the functional tests and the trig LEDs;
  - OCTABAM8: beside KITS and DIRECT JUMP;
  - OCTABAM9: 32 steps and the other trig modes.
- CF METER measured the unit's load with and without the module.
- Instruction counts were measured under the emulator; chip cycles per
  detour were not. No image built by Modwerk's own builder has been tested
  on a unit yet.

  0x400a2d76  audio tick: the pattern argument of 0x4009d1e8
  0x400a39c0  MIDI tick: the pattern argument of 0x4009cf4c
  0x4009dc8c  audio rebuild after an edit: the pattern argument (8, padded)
  0x4009e3e2  MIDI rebuild: the same (8, padded)
  0x400a3d88  audio per-track advance: the length the counter wraps at
  0x400a3ea8  MIDI per-track advance: the same
  0x40056b50  PATTERN layer's trig press: the gesture, with a TRACK key held
  0x4007e9b6  LED dispatcher, after a page's LED callback: the trig LEDs of a
              track on its own pattern (blink in GRID REC, its trigs outside,
              its pattern in the PATTERN layer while TRACK is held)

Play Modes' step-load and rebuild detours (0x400a2d6a, 0x400a39b6,
0x4009dc86, 0x4009e3dc) end where these begin; the two share no byte.
